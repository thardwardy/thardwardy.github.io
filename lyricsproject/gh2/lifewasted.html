			<p>	You're always saying that there's something wrong<br>
				I'm starting to believe it's your plan all along<br>
				Death came around, forced to hear its song<br>
				And know tomorrow can't be depended on<br>
				<br>
				I've seen the home inside your head<br>
				All locked doors and unmade beds<br>
				Open sores unattended<br>
				Let me say just once that<br>
				I've faced it, a life wasted<br>
				I'm never going back again<br>
				Oh I escaped it, a life wasted<br>
				I'm never going back again<br>
				Having tasted, a life wasted<br>
				I'm never going back again<br>
				<br>
				The world awaits just up the stairs<br>
				Leave the pain for someone else<br>
				Nothing back there for you to find<br>
				Or was it you, you left behind?<br>
				<br>
				You're always saying you're too weak to be strong<br>
				You're harder on yourself than just about anyone<br>
				Why swim the channel just to get this far?<br>
				Oh halfway there, why would you turn around?<br>
				Darkness comes in waves<br>
				Tell me, why invite it to stay?<br>
				You're warm with negativity<br>
				Yes comfort is an energy<br>
				But why let the sad song play?<br>
				Ha ha ha ha ha<br>
				<br>
				I've faced it, a life wasted<br>
				I'm never going back again<br>
				Oh I escaped it, a life wasted<br>
				I'm never going back again<br>
				Having tasted, a life wasted<br>
				I'm never going back again<br>
				Oh I erased it, a life wasted<br>
				I'm never going back again</p>
