			<p>	(Shout shout shout)<br>
				(Shout shout shout)<br>
				Shout at the devil!<br>
				<br>
				He's the wolf screaming lonely in the night<br>
				He's the blood stain on the stage<br>
				He's the tear in your eye<br>
				Been tempted by his lie<br>
				He's the knife in your back<br>
				He's rage<br>
				Well he's the razor to the knife<br>
				Oh, lonely is our lives<br>
				My heads spinnin' round and round<br>
				But in the seasons of wither<br>
				We'll stand and deliver<br>
				Be strong and laugh and-<br>
				<br>
				(Shout shout shout)<br>
				Shout at the devil<br>
				(Shout shout shout)<br>
				<br>
				He'll be the love in your eyes<br>
				He'll be the blood between your thighs<br>
				And then have you Cry for more<br>
				He'll put strength to the test<br>
				He'll put the thrill back in bed<br>
				I'm sure you've heard it all before<br>
				He'll be the risk in the kiss<br>
				Might be anger on your lips<br>
				Might run scared for the door<br>
				But in the seasons of wither<br>
				We'll stand and deliver<br>
				Be strong and laugh and<br>
				<br>
				(Shout shout shout)<br>
				Shout at the devil<br>
				(Shout shout shout)<br>
				Shout at the devil<br>
				<br>
				He's the wolf screaming lonely in the night<br>
				He's the blood stain on the stage<br>
				He's the tear in your eye<br>
				Been tempted by his lie<br>
				He's the knife in your back<br>
				He's rage<br>
				Well he's the razor to the knife<br>
				Oh, lonely is our lives<br>
				My heads spinnin' round and round<br>
				But in the seasons of wither<br>
				We'll stand and deliver<br>
				Be strong and laugh and-<br>
				<br>
