			<p>Merry is the man<br>
				With money in his hand<br>
				With grease between the wheels<br>
				And lamps in his latrine<br>
				<br>
				Stacks of fresh towels for his wet hands<br>
				Counting up all his toys<br>
				Draining tent fire from the neighbours<br>
				Sermons from soldier boys<br>
				<br>
				Like our young cadet<br>
				Whose lords require sweat<br>
				'Til Spain is on its ass<br>
				Surrend'ring Philippines<br>
				<br>
				He's stuck in ruts wearing lead pants<br>
				Buried chest-deep in a Maginot<br>
				Wondering when he'll touch flesh again<br>
				Next chance he gets, he must tell her<br>
				<br>
				Oh, you've got radium eyes<br>
				You've got radium eyes<br>
				Yeah, you've got radium eyes<br>
				You've got radium eyes<br>
				Yeah, you've got radium eyes<br>
				<br>
				(Your radium-)<br>
				(Your radium eyes)<br>
				(Your radium-)<br>
				<br>
				He can see his girl<br>
				With temporary curls<br>
				Her doorbell fetching maid<br>
				Pour fÃªtes a la piscine<br>
				<br>
				But she's working, changing the bedpans<br>
				In cities when none but daughters roam<br>
				Stretchers fill every cathedral<br>
				Tarpaulins drip from each broken dome<br>
				<br>
				You've got radium eyes<br>
				You've got radium eyes<br>
				Yeah, you've got radium eyes<br>
				You've got radium eyes<br>
				Yeah<br>
				<br>
				You've got radium eyes<br>
				You've got radium eyes<br>
				Yeah, you've got (your eyes)<br>
				You've got radium eyes<br>
				Yeah, you've got (your eyes)<br>
				You've got radium eyes<br>
				Yeah</p>
