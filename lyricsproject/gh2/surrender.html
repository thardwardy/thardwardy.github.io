			<p>	Mother told me, yes she told me, I'd meet girls like you<br>
				She also told me "Stay away, you'll never know what you'll catch"<br>
				Just the other day I heard a soldier's falling off<br>
				Some Indonesian junk that's going 'round<br>
				<br>
				Mummy's all right, Daddy's all right<br>
				They just seem a little weird<br>
				Surrender surrender<br>
				But don't give yourself away hey hey<br>
				<br>
				Father says "Your mother's right, she's really up on things<br>
				Before we married, Mummy served in the WACS in the Philippines"<br>
				Now I had heard the WACS recruited old maids for the war<br>
				But mummy isn't one of those, I've known her all these years<br>
				<br>
				Mummy's all right, Daddy's all right<br>
				They just seem a little weird<br>
				Surrender surrender<br>
				But don't give yourself away hey hey<br>
				<br>
				Whatever happened to all this season's losers of the year?<br>
				Every time I got to thinking, when they disappear?<br>
				Then when I woke up, Mum and Dad are rolling on the couch<br>
				Rolling numbers, rock and rollin' got my KISS records out<br>
				<br>
				Mummy's all right, Daddy's all right<br>
				They just seem a little weird<br>
				Surrender surrender<br>
				But don't give yourself away hey hey<br>
				<br>
				Away!<br>
				Away!<br>
				<br>
				(Surrender Surrender)<br>
				Mummy's all right, Daddy's alright<br>
				(But don't give yourself away)<br>
				(Surrender Surrender)<br>
				Mummy's all right, Daddy's alright<br>
				(But don't give yourself away)<br>
				(Surrender Surrender)<br>
				Mummy's all right, Daddy's alright<br>
				(But don't give yourself away)<br>
				(Surrender Surrender)<br>
				Mummy's all right, Daddy's alright<br>
				(But don't give yourself away)<br>
				Robbin's alright, Rick's alright<br>
				(Surrender Surrender)<br>
				We're all alright, we're all alright<br>
				(But don't give yourself away)<br>
				We're all alright! We're all alright!</p>
