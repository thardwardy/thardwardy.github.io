			<p>	I know a thing or two about her<br>
				I know she'll only make you cry<br>
				She'll let you walk the street beside her<br>
				Oh!<br>
				But when she wants she'll pass you by<br>
				<br>
				Everybody says she's looking good<br>
				And the lady knows it's understood<br>
				Strutter<br>
				<br>
				She wears her satins like a lady<br>
				She gets her way just like a child<br>
				You take her home and she says "Maybe, baby."<br>
				She takes you down and drives you wild<br>
				<br>
				Everybody says she's looking good<br>
				And the lady knows it's understood<br>
				Strutter<br>
				<br>
				Oh I know a thing or two about her<br>
				I know she'll only make you cry<br>
				She'll let you walk the street beside her<br>
				But when she wants, she'll pass you by<br>
				Ow<br>
				<br>
				Everybody says she's looking good<br>
				And the lady knows it's understood<br>
				Strutter<br>
